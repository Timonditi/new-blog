    Kisumu’s Washington Ochieng and Nondies Calvin Sheunda traded penalties, the match finely poised at 6-3 courtesy of Ochieng’s success rate from the kicking tee in this match day three clash at the RFUEA.

    Bruce Odhiambo then grounded the 100th try of the new season to give Nondies an 8-6 lead before Ochieng and Sheunda again traded penalties, Nondies taking the 11-9 lead into the interval.

    Kenya U20 winger Alvin Mwamburi scored after the restart, Ochieng converting to see Kisumu lead 16-11 before collapsing under the weight of relentless Nondies pressure.

    Sheunda would convert tries from Ian Mumbwani, Oliver Tambo and Ben Saleh to claim the bonus point victory for Nondies
